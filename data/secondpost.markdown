My portfolio site is about 50% done. I still need to make the **about me** page and the **contact page**. Also some clean up. This post is for organizing my thought and providing another test sample for the site.  
The following are what I have done:  
- Decided a overall style
- Created layouts for main page, folio page, blog page and article page(used for presenting a complete blog post)
- Created card elements, card-view and blog-card for previewing purspose.
- Able to fetch data from my Tumblr account.  

What I still need to do:
- Create customized pages for each of the projects I want to put in the porfolio
- Clean up Javascript for performance
- Clean up CSS
- Vulcanize custom elements
- Work on SEO  

Seems like I still have a lot to work on.
