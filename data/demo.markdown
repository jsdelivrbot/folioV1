#I am making an _awesome_ [portfolio](yiochen.github.io)
**_Yes_** Iâ€™m making my portfolio sites!. I have been learning HTML and CSS
for a while, but never tried to do a complete project.  
This site is currently under construction. I have already made the 
basic layout. _see the screenshot below_  
![awesome screenshot](https://github.com/yiochen/yiou-portfolio/raw/master/screen/main.png?raw=true)  
I am writing this post in markdown because I am going to link my portfolio with this tumblr
account and make it fetch my post automatically. I will use Javascript 
to parse the markdown directly on the **client side**. So I am using 
as much markdown features as possible. Following is a list I use to keep track of the features:  
1. Different heading size
2. Image
3. Text decoration
 * **bold**
 * _Italic_
4. Quote
5. Line break
6. Link  

If you happen to read this post, please bear with me. Because this is almost for testing
purpose only. If you see this post from my portfolio site, that 
means **_I succeeded!!!_**  
Now, give it a quote:
>You might not think that programmers are artists, but programming is an extremely creative profession. It's logic-based creativity.
--John Romero  

I guess that's about it. So
