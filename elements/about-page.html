                        <h5>I am Yiou (pronounced as "E.O"), currently a Computer Science/Digital Art student at Stony Brook University, NY. I am interested in designing, coding, shooting photos, blending colors, folding origami, etc.  In one word, I enjoy any process of creating things. For design, I use Photoshop and Illustrator. For front end, I use Skeleton (an awesome grid framework), and Polymer(yes, fancy web components). I am always passionate about learning new stuff. In my folio, you will find me tried out Android app, Dart game, Pebble smart watch app and so on. Some of them are personal projects. Some are projects from Hackathons. I am currently in school, but I am available for small projects and would be available for full time in summer. If you want to know more about me, donâ€™t hesitate to shoot me with a rocket of emails!</h5>
